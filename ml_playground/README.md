This is a Plotly Dash dashboard built in Python which aims to be a visually informative and mathematically explanatative guide to common machine learning algorithm. The goal is to build it out enough to provide an all in one tool to learning machine learning algorithm in a very straightforward and complete manner. You can run this code by pulling the code and running "Python3 index.py" in the directory.

TODO:

Add more algorithms

    Complete a full prototype for SVM to act as a baseline for other models
    Split data into train and test
    Add more graphs for Residuals, Feature Selection, etc
    Add Chat-GPT functionality in order to be able to ask questions within the dashboard and receive explanations
    Redesign Results layout
    Verify best practices for Dash code layout
